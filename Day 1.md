# SOAP, REST and GraphQL

## SOAP & REST

I read about SOAP and REST [here](https://searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com/definition/SOAP-Simple-Object-Access-Protocol). REST seems to be the preferred choice.
<br>
Currently, I'm using Retrofit and FastAndroidNetworking with GSON for consuming REST APIs in Android.

## GraphQL

GraphQL seems to have a lot of advantages over REST. The [official website](https://graphql.org/) tells all the advantages over REST. Basically, it has selective quering, which makes it far more superior than REST.

Apollo looks like a good library to consume GraphQL on Android. Find it here:<br>
